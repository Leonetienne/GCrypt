# Ghettocrypt
*because frankly i have no idea what the fuck i'm doing*  
<sub>*Please don't use this for anything critical*</sub>

## What the hell is this?
An educational project on implementing a block cipher using a feistel network.  
To provide at least some security this is using some DES-inspired tactics like *cipher block chaining* and *output feedback modus*.
This way this provides relatively good diffusion.

## Features
* It has a very easy syntax
* It's slow
* It's probably super insecure
* It leaves your keys sprinkled in ram
* But the syntax is pythonlike easy🙇  

It's pretty ghetto, you know?

## What are the actual advantages?
* It's two files to import into the project
* 1 Line to use
* 100% cross plattform

## When could i use it?
* For data obfuscation
* If your only other option would be no encryption at all

### I am not kidding, don't use this for critical stuff! Homebrew ciphers are most often shit!
Especially mine!🦯
