# Ghettocrypt
*because frankly i have no idea what the fuck i'm doing*  
<sub>*Please don't use this for anything critical*</sub>

## What the hell is this?
An educational project on implementing a block cipher using a feistel network.  
This block cipher employs a few modes of operation. Read more about them [here](#modes-of-operation).

## Features
* It has very easy syntax
* It's slow
* It absolutely tanks your ram when working with files
* Even leaves some key fragments in there✨
* It's probably super insecure
* 512-bit keys <sup>\*</sup>
* But the syntax is pythonlike easy🙇

It's pretty ghetto, you know?

## What are the actual advantages?
* It's two files to import into your project
* 1 Line to use
* 100% cross plattform

## What could I use it for?
* For data obfuscation
* If your only other option would be no encryption at all

### I am not kidding, don't use this for critical stuff! Homebrew ciphers tend to be shit!
Especially mine!🗡️  
Even assumed it's a good cipher, it's implementation leaves a lot to be desired in terms of being cryptographically secure. The whole leaving partial keys in ram- thingy...

## How do I use this?
### *"I don't care about the library. Just let me use it from the command line!"*
There is a CLI version availabile [here](https://github.com/Leonetienne/GhettoCrypt/tree/master/GhettoCryptCLI).

### Installation as a library
Download the `.h` and `.cpp` file from [INCLUDE/](https://github.com/Leonetienne/GhettoCrypt/tree/master/INCLUDE) and add them to your projects files. *Single-header-magic*.

### Working with strings
```c++
using namespace GhettoCipher;

// Get some string
const std::string input = "I am a super secret message!";
std::cout << input << std::endl;

// Encrypt
const std::string encrypted = GhettoCryptWrapper::EncryptString(input, "password1");
std::cout << encrypted << std::endl;

// Decrypt
const std::string decrypted = GhettoCryptWrapper::DecryptString(encrypted, "password1");
std::cout << decrypted << std::endl;
```

### Working with files
```c++
using namespace GhettoCipher;

// Encrypt
GhettoCryptWrapper::EncryptFile("main.cpp", "main.cpp.crypt", "password1");

// Decrypt
GhettoCryptWrapper::DecryptFile("main.cpp.crypt", "main.cpp.clear", "password1");
```

If you want to do more complex stuff, use the cipher-class [`GhettoCipher::Cipher`](https://github.com/Leonetienne/GhettoCrypt/blob/master/GhettoCrypt/Cipher.h) aswell as the conversion methods in [Util.h](https://github.com/Leonetienne/GhettoCrypt/blob/master/GhettoCrypt/Util.h). This way you can cipher on bitlevel. Examples on how to do this are in [GhettoCryptWrapper.cpp](https://github.com/Leonetienne/GhettoCrypt/blob/master/GhettoCrypt/GhettoCryptWrapper.cpp).
This way you could, for example, decrypt an ecrypted file directly into memory. Or use a full-length key instead of a password.
Without saying, this is more advanced and not as-easy as the methods supplied in the wrapper.

---
<sup>\*</sup> A key is always of size `BLOCK_SIZE`. The default block size is 512 (bit), but you can easily change it in [Config.h](https://github.com/Leonetienne/GhettoCrypt/blob/master/GhettoCrypt/Config.h) or wherever it'll be put in the INCLUDE/*.cpp. `BLOCK_SIZE` is also the minimal output length!

## The deets 🍝

### Modes of operation
* [CBC] This block cipher makes use of cipher block chaining. Nothing special.
* [IV] The initialization vector is indeed a bit of special sauce, as it depends on your key instead of being static. It is generated by running the feistel network on *E(m=seed, k=seed)*.
* [RRKM] Never heard of a mode like this, so i've named it **R**olling**R**ound**K**ey**M**ode. This basically means that the round key extrapolation is carried out continously over EVERY round on EVERY block. So in addition to *M<sub>i</sub>* being dependent on *E(M<sub>i-1</sub>,K<sub>i-1,0</sub>)* due to CBC, so is now *K<sub>i</sub>* dependent on *K<sub>i-1,r</sub>* with *r* being the maximum number of extrapolated keys within a call of *E()*. This is handled within the feistel network class, as an instance lifecycle sees all blocks, if you want to take a peek.

### Password to key
How does *GC* transform a password to a key?  
First up, we have to establish what requirements this transformation must fulfill:
* A full key. Not just *len(passwd)\*8* bits and the rest zero-padded.
* Even if *len(passwd\*8) > KEY_SIZE*, every bit of the password should affect the key
* Ideally good collision resistance

Let's be honest, I'm not a cryptographer, i have no idea how collision resistant this is.
This means, it has to be considered *insecure*!
I have tried a few passwords brute-forcibly, experimentally (about 1mil) and have not been able to produce a collision.
Obviously there have to be collisions, since *|P|, len\(p\) &#8712; &#8501;  &#8811; |C|*.

How does it work? Basically, what happens is your password gets recoded to binary. It is then split into blocks of
size KEY_SIZE, they are &xoplus; together, and this single block is then encrypted with itself as a key.

The end result is the key corresponding to your password.
This is a one-way operation. Since the key used for this operation is the cleartext itself, you cannot undo it without already
knowing the password(=cleartext) to begin with. *You could make a hashfunction out of this.*
